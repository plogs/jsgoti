Should D.E.I. die?

Social engineering

differences within families (brothers and sisters)
generalizations about minorities
first do no harm


Suppose one group of women were unfairly sterilized in the past
(based only on their skin color), and that caused there to
be fewer of those types of women alive today.

Suppose also that this past problem is something that we must try to
address today. We must suppose this because it's not clear how or
even if we can 'fix' something that happened in the past.

The idea of DEI, then, is that we assume we need to do social
engineering now, in order to 'level the playing field', in order to
somehow make up for the bad things that happened in the past.

But remember, no one harmed in the past is alive today. And no one
alive today had anything to do with the bad actions in the past.

How do we fix things now?

We do the bad thing that was done in the past, but this time to a
different group of innocent people. That is, we sterilize women who
are alive today (based only on their skin color), in order to make up
for having sterilized minority women in the past (based only on their
skin color).


The Hippocratic Oath that doctors take says, "First do no harm."

Now sometimes a doctor will need to do harm in order to save the
patient. For example, if your feet or hands are gangrene beyond
saving, then the doctor might need to cut off your feet or hands in
order to save your arms or legs. Gangrene is progressive. Sometimes
you have to do a little harm in order to prevent an even bigger harm.

But DEI doesn't seem like that. Why? Because DEI isn't doing a little
harm to prevent a bigger harm; instead, DEI is intentionally harming
innocent individuals in the hopes that the harm to innocent
individuals will somehow be balanced out by making society better
overall.

How will we know when to stop?  No one can say.
