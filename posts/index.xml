      <description>A scalp dance
At the beginning of many events it&amp;rsquo;s now fashionable to begin with an indigenous land acknowledgment, usually something along these lines:
&#34;We would like to begin by acknowledging that we are in ___________, the ancestral and unceded territory of the ________ People.&#34; The ostensible goal of these acknowledgments is to promote a &amp;ldquo;greater public consciousness of Native sovereignty and cultural rights.&amp;rdquo; 1
But strangely, these acknowledgments seem always a bit myopic.</description>

      <title>Pete Buttigieg Explains DEI to Regular Folks</title>

      <description>And I explain to you why DEI is mostly wrong I like Pete Buttigieg. I will likely vote for him if he runs for president in 2028, but I disagree with him about Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI).
I&amp;rsquo;m writing this because I want democrats to stop screwing up so badly. I think the Republican party has lost its way, which leaves Democrats as our only hope. Unfortunately, the Democratic party (and seemingly America1) is in sad shape.</description>

      <title>Why Trans Rights Are Not Gay</title>

      <description>Gay rights Gays wanted to be treated the same. Human being to human being.
If a man can fight and defend his country, then why can&amp;rsquo;t a gay man fight and defend his country?
If a man and a woman can love each other and engage in a social/legal contracts (e.g., marriage), then why can&amp;rsquo;t two women or two men do the same?
Trans rights But trans rights are different because trans individuals want to be treated the same as non-trans individuals, even when it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense.</description>

      <description>Beware the parasocial relationship A parasocial relationship is a one-sided emotional attachment that a viewer or audience member develops with a media personality (e.g., a TV host, YouTuber, podcaster, or fictional character). While the viewer may feel a sense of closeness or friendship, the media figure has no awareness of the viewer&amp;rsquo;s existence.
Key Features:
Illusion of intimacy -- The viewer feels like they ``know&#39;&#39; the person. One-sided -- There&#39;s no mutual interaction.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Economics is an analysis of cause-and-effect relationships in an economy. Its purpose is to discern the consequences of various ways of allocating scarce resources which have alternative uses. It has nothing to say about social philosophy or moral values, any more than it has anything to say about humor or anger.&amp;rdquo;1
Thomas Sowell, Basic Economics: A Common Sense Guide to the Economy, 5th ed. (2015), pp. 64-65.&amp;#160;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;</description>
