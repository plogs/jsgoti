  <section><p>We acknowledge<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that here in the
United States, we are on the ancestral and unceded territory of
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_culture">Clovis People</a>.</p>
<p>The Clovis culture refers to one of the earliest known prehistoric
Native American cultures in North America, recognized primarily for
its distinctive stone tools. It is named after the town of Clovis,
New Mexico, where such artifacts were first identified in the 1930s.</p>
<p>It is believed that Clovis people crossed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beringia">Bering Land
Bridge</a> from Siberia and
moved south through an ice-free corridor into the central U.S., thus
becoming the first inhabitants of North America.</p>
<p>Current speculation suggests that Clovis land was never legally ceded
or given freely. Thus, though still debated, it&rsquo;s believed their
land stolen by the ancestors of the 574 federally recognized tribes
still in existence today. (See below.)</p>
<p>The speculation is bolstered by the following observations:</p>
<p>Violence between Native American tribes took many forms.</p>
<p>Raids were often conducted to steal horses, take captives, or exact
revenge for past offenses.</p>
<p>War captives were executed in ritual ways, sometimes involving
torture, as a form of spiritual justice or communal healing.</p>
<p>Indigenous slavery existed in some regions even before European
contact, though it differed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery">chattel
slavery</a>.</p>
<p>Scalping occurred both before and after European contact, though
colonial powers (like the British and French) later encouraged it
with bounties.</p>
<p>Raiding was sometimes a way of life, targeting rival tribes or
agricultural villages.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that post-Clovis violence was not
continuous or universal&mdash;many tribes maintained long-standing peace
with neighbors and used diplomacy, intermarriage, and trade to manage
relations.</p>
<p>Violence among Native American tribes was complex, culturally
specific, and deeply contextual. It&rsquo;s best understood not as
senseless brutality but as part of broader social, spiritual, and
political systems.</p>
