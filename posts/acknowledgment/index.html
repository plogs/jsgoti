  <section><p>Here in the United States, we acknowledge<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that we are in
the ancestral and unceded territory of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_culture">Clovis
People</a>.</p>
<p>The Clovis culture refers to one of the earliest known prehistoric
Native American cultures in North America, recognized primarily for
its distinctive stone tools. It is named after the town of Clovis,
New Mexico, where such artifacts were first identified in the 1930s.</p>
<p>It is believed that Clovis people crossed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beringia">Bering Land
Bridge</a> from Siberia and
moved south through an ice-free corridor into the central U.S., thus
becoming the first inhabitants of North America, approximately 12,800
years ago.</p>
<p>Clovis culture pre-dates our modern concept of land ownership, thus
Clovis land could never have been legally ceded or given freely.
Successor cultures simply appropriated Clovis land as their own.</p>
<p>All 574 federally recognized tribes<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> still in existence today (e.g,
Cherokee, Choctaw, Sioux, Comanche, Chnook, Inuit) occupied the
former lands of the Clovis people, prior to subsequent appropriation
by European colonists, Spanish explorers, and English settlers.</p>
<p>Land appropriation and culture erasure was likely violent and
unforgiving, as evidenced by our knowledge of Native American
Nations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Violence between Native American tribes took many forms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raids were often conducted to steal horses, take captives, or exact
revenge for past offenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>War captives were executed in ritual ways, sometimes involving
torture, as a form of spiritual justice or communal healing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indigenous slavery existed in some regions even before European
contact, though it differed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery">chattel
slavery</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scalping occurred both before and after European contact, though
colonial powers (like the British and French) later encouraged it
with bounties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raiding was sometimes a way of life, targeting rival tribes or
agricultural villages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be noted, however, that violence among Native American
tribes was complex, culturally specific, and deeply contextual. It&rsquo;s
best understood not as senseless brutality but as part of broader
social, spiritual, and political systems.</p>
<p>Many tribes maintained long-standing peace
with neighbors and used diplomacy, intermarriage, and trade to manage
relations.</p>
