<h2 id="transcript-pete-buttigieg-speaking">Transcript, Pete Buttigieg speaking</h2>
<p>&ldquo;First of all, DEI stands for diversity, equity, and inclusion, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So to me we start by thinking okay, what&rsquo;s the opposite of those
things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The opposite of diversity is uniformity, right?&rdquo;</p>
<!--
----------------------------------------------------------------------
-->
<div class="myreply">
<p>Uh, no &ndash; not necessarily. First we have to ask what exactly is
meant by `diversity&rsquo;? Does diversity in this context mean it&rsquo;s
somehow better to hire or work with people with different skin
color, different sexual orientations, different shoe sizes,
different social-economic backgrounds, different heights, different
IQs? What&rsquo;s the criteria &ndash; and what makes the criteria relevant &ndash;
for deciding which characteristics are diverse-worthy?</p>
<p>Context matters.</p>
<p>When it comes to hiring someone for a job, the opposite of
diversity might be &lsquo;color blind&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And in some situations diversity is a weakness, not a strength.</p>
<p>For example, anyone who has dealt with Customer Support from a
non-native English speaker knows the importance of clear
communication. Sometimes I just want to say, &ldquo;Oh my gosh, please&hellip;
give me more uniformity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The usual and obvious counter example to &lsquo;diversity&rsquo; are the
players in the NBA (National Basketball Association). 70% of NBA
players are Black (or African American). Do we need more Asians and
Native Americans on our basketball teams in the name of diversity?
I don&rsquo;t think so. Why would skin color, shoe size, or sexual
orientation matter when shooting a free throw? And if it doesn&rsquo;t
matter when shooting a free throw, then why would it matter when
tightening bolts on a factory assembly line, or when pouring coffee
at Starbucks?</p>
<p>I think when DEI proponents say &lsquo;diversity&rsquo; that&rsquo;s actually
shorthand for &lsquo;social engineering.&rsquo; They want to fix society&rsquo;s
discrimination problem, and forced diversity is their proposed way
to do that. But there&rsquo;s very little rhyme or reason to the proposed
solution. Not to mention the cost of giving someone an advantage
because they&rsquo;re Black, or White, or Asian, or gay, or whatever. The
whole point of working towards a non-discriminatory society is to
stop treating people by their accidental and mostly irrelevant
group characteristics, and, instead, treat everyone as an
individual.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The opposite of equity is inequity.&rdquo;</p>
<!--
----------------------------------------------------------------------
-->
<div class="myreply">
<p>It&rsquo;s true that the opposite of equity is inequity, just as the
opposite of fair is unfair. But what seems to be wanted by DEI is
not fairness, as in &ldquo;everyone plays by the same rules,&rdquo; but rather,
equity as in, &ldquo;equal outcomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For example, if SOMEGROUP MEMBERS are 5% of the population, then
DEI proponents presume that in an &rsquo;equitable&rsquo; society we would
expect to see 5% of SOMEGROUP MEMBERS distributed proportionally
throughout the workforce.</p>
<p>But why this type of distribution should be expected is assumed but
never explained. Why do we expect all GROUPS to be equally
proportionally distributed?</p>
<p>One reason GROUPS might not be equally proportionally distributed
is because &ndash; statistically speaking &ndash; different groups have
different strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Culture, for example, plays a significant part in outcomes (again,
statistically speaking).</p>
<p>For example, the usual study time for Asian students can be as high
as 10 hours per day. Whereas American students study for a whopping
1-2 hours. Regardless of the percentage of the population, which
group do you think will do better on knowledge tests?</p>
<p>Does it follow, then, that if the number of Asian students with
highly technical and great paying jobs exceeds the proportional
distribution of American students with highly technical and great
paying jobs, that that&rsquo;s somehow &lsquo;inequitable&rsquo;? Do we need to fix
society because when Asian kids grow up they do better then White
kids?</p>
<p>These different definitions of &rsquo;equity&rsquo; are often described as the
difference between &ldquo;equal opportunity&rdquo; and &ldquo;equal outcome&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Equal opportunity is the very definition of fairness: everyone
plays by the same rules, every one gets a fair chance. Equal
outcome, on the other hand, is social engineering writ large.
Equal outcome adherents basically want to play god; they want
to fix society to be the way it should be.</p>
<p>There are several problems with &rsquo;equal outcome.&rsquo; First, not
everyone agrees there is a problem to be solved. Second, not
everyone agrees on the best way to fix the problem. And third,
sometimes the best of intentioned solutions have unforeseen side
effects resulting in even bigger problems.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the opposite of inclusion is exclusion.&rdquo;</p>
<!--
----------------------------------------------------------------------
-->
<div class="myreply">
<p>This is the one part that DEI technically gets correct.</p>
<p>Yes, we do not want to <em>exclude</em> anyone unfairly. But the
opposite of exclusion (i.e., inclusion), can also be taken to
extremes, which may be even worse. Exclusion is doing a bad thing
for bad reasons; over-including is doing a bad thing for good
reasons, thus blinding ourselves to the harm being down behind a
patina of moral good.</p>
<p>For example, as previously mentioned, we don&rsquo;t want to force Asians
to be included in the NBA just because Asians are proportionally
underrepresented population-wise.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t know a lot of people who think we&rsquo;d be better off if our
lives had more uniformity, inequity, and exclusion, right?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="myreply">
  Pete, maybe you should get out more.
<p>Roughly half of the country voted for the anti-DEI candidate in 2024.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I think part of why people have questions about it, that I
respect, is they&rsquo;re not sure if this is they&rsquo;re worried about
fairness, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So to me when you talk about some of these policies the idea is to
make sure everybody gets a seat at the table, especially if you know
there have been systematic ways of keeping people from getting a seat
at the table over the years, sometimes based on their race, on their
religion, on their income, on their background, any number of
reasons. Sexuality, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a lot of different reasons, and it&rsquo;s about making sure that what
we do going forward is fair.&rdquo;</p>
<!--
----------------------------------------------------------------------
-->
<div class="myreply">
<p>Yes, Pete, people have questions because they&rsquo;re worried about
fairness. If by fairness we mean <em>everyone plays by the same
rules</em>, then it doesn&rsquo;t seem fair that someone with black skin
color [to use the American slavery example], who was never ever a
slave, somehow gets a seat at the table ahead of someone else with
white skin color, who was never ever a slave owner &ndash; just because
of their skin color.</p>
<p>There are not an infinite number of seats at the table. Resources
are always limited &ndash; time, money, employees. If employers could
hire everyone, then &rsquo;everybody gets a seat at the table.&rsquo; But
that&rsquo;s not reality. So we have to make choices. How do we choose?
Some people feel that using skin color as a criteria is a decidedly
unfair and hence bad way to choose.</p>
<p>Given two identically qualified candidates, one White and one
Black, it would seem <em>more fair</em> to decide between them by
simply flipping a coin, as opposed to preferring one skin color (or
race or religion or sexuality or whatever) over another skin color,
especially when one&rsquo;s skin color is not something one chooses, and
when one&rsquo;s skin color has nothing to do with the job at hand.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And this can be an economic issue, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look at something like redlining. A lot of homeowners, families
would be homeowners, especially black families, couldn&rsquo;t get homes in
certain neighborhoods where the property value started to go up, so
even if that happened to a family, I don&rsquo;t know 50 years ago, their
kids are living with the consequences of that now because their
family has less wealth because they were kept out of a neighborhood
where property values were growing, right?&rdquo;</p>
<!--
----------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="myreply">
<p>Success in life is due to many things, but a high level assessment
would likely include these four factors: circumstances, genetics,
effort, and luck.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re born rich, generally you do better. If you&rsquo;re born tall
or beautiful, you generally do better. If your culture encourages
you to work hard, you&rsquo;ll likely do better than someone in similar
circumstances who works less hard. And then there&rsquo;s luck, which
trumps all.</p>
<p>What responsibility do people today have for events of the past,
when people today had no control over what happened in the
past? None.</p>
<p>Do we want to work towards making things more fair, in the sense of
treating everyone equally? Yes. That&rsquo;s why we erase redlining and
jettison Jim Crow laws.</p>
<p>Are there still bigots, racists, and homophobes. To be sure, and
there probably always will be; humans are weird and diverse!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, one&rsquo;s unlucky heritage is not a good enough excuse
for penalizing innocents in the present.</p>
<p>So you weren&rsquo;t born rich. You&rsquo;re short and not too attractive. You
watch TV instead of study. Your black parents couldn&rsquo;t get a home
in a certain neighborhood. Guess what, you&rsquo;re unlucky.
Welcome to the human race.</p>
<p>Will you succeed?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s up to you. Any excuse will do.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And so part of it&rsquo;s the idea that some of these things may have
started a long time ago. Maybe nobody alive today is responsible for
some of the injustice that has shaped what it&rsquo;s like to live in this
country right now, but all of us now are responsible for doing
something about it.&rdquo;</p>
<!--
----------------------------------------------------------------------
-->
<div class="myreply">
<p>Sure, Pete, let&rsquo;s do something about it. But let&rsquo;s not do stupid
things about it.</p>
<p>The English proverb, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry over spilt milk,&rdquo; was first recorded
in the 17th century.</p>
<p>Today, it seems, DEI not only wants to cry over past spilt milk, it
wants to use past injustices to justify spilling new milk today; as
if spilling new milk today will magically &ldquo;unspill&rdquo; the milk of the
past.</p>
<p>No amount of whining or virtue signaling can redo the past. What do
we do instead? In the case of slavery, we clean up and move on, which
is what we&rsquo;ve been trying to do ever since the Civil War, the
deadliest war in American history.</p>
