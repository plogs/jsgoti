At the beginning of many events
it's now fashionable to begin with
an _indigenous land acknowledgment_, usually something along these
lines:

<div style='margin-left: .5em; margin-right: .5em; padding: 1em; background-color: #ffcc99; font-family: monospace;'>
"We would like to begin by acknowledging that we are in
___________, the ancestral and unceded territory of the ________
People."
</div>

The ostensible goal of these acknowledgments is to promote a "greater
public consciousness of Native sovereignty and cultural
rights." [^neefusa]

But strangely, these acknowledgments seem always a bit myopic. If
we're going to acknowledge ancestral and unceded territory of
modern-day North America, how far
back do we look? To the 
[Clovis
People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_culture)?

Clovis refers to the earliest [^debated] known prehistoric
Native American culture. One theory is that the
Clovis people crossed the [Bering Land
Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beringia) from Siberia and
moved south through an ice-free corridor into the central U.S.,
approximately 12,800 years ago. (See also [Peopling of the
Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopling_of_the_Americas).)

Clovis culture pre-dates our modern-day concept of land ownership, so
Clovis land could never have been legally ceded or given freely.

Today, the 574 federally recognized [^recognized] tribes (Cherokee,
Choctaw, Sioux, Comanche, Chnook, Inuit, etc.) occupy land that was
once the home of the Clovis people. This land, in turn, was
subsequently appropriated by Spanish explorers, English settlers, and
other European colonists.

Given what we know of human nature in general, and Native American
populations in particular, it seems safe to assume that land
appropriation throughout history (from the Clovis culture thousands
of years ago to modern tribes today -- even prior to European
colonization, circa 1492), was likely violent and unforgiving.

 * Violence between Native American tribes took many forms. [^violence]

 * War captives were executed in ritual ways, sometimes involving
   torture, as a form of spiritual justice or communal healing. [^war]

 * Indigenous slavery existed in some regions even before European
   contact. [^slavery]

 * Scalping occurred both before and after European contact, though
   colonial powers (like the British and French) later encouraged it
   with bounties.[^scalping] [^scalp1] [^scalp2] [^scalp3] [^scalp4]

 * Raiding was sometimes a way of life, targeting rival tribes or
   agricultural villages. [^raiding]


Not all was violence, of course. Many tribes maintained long-standing
peace with neighbors and used diplomacy, intermarriage, and trade to
manage relations. [^peace]

# Indigenous virtue signaling

Most of the time "indigenous" means first, but it can also refer to
people, plants, or animals that originate from, or have a
long-standing connection to, a specific place. Other terms used
include "Native" and "First Nations."

So maybe acknowledging Clovis is going back too far.

But the question remains: How far back _do_ we go when
acknowledging "public consciousness of Native sovereignty and
cultural rights"?

Native American nations today are indigenous to North America in the
First Nations use of "indigenous." Undoubtedly some of these Native
American nations displaced _other_ Indigenous nations, even before
European colonization. [^displaced] [^warfare]

So mostly it seems, we're [virtue
signaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_signalling).
Our culture is better.

Our culture is better because we self-shame ourselves with land
acknowledgments. Which is to say, we acknowledge our occupation of
unceded land that was unceremoniously appropriated from an indigenous
tribe that managed to occupy unceded land from a prior indigenous
tribe, who managed to occupy ancestral and unceded territory from a
_prior_ prior tribe or nation; and so on and so forth, all the way
back to the Clovis people, who's distant ancestors ultimately
originated in Africa. [^c1] [^c2]
