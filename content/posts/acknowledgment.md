In many organizations and events it's now fashionable to begin with
an _indigenous land acknowledgment_, usually something along these
lines:

<div style='margin-left: .5em; margin-right: .5em; padding: 1em; background-color: #ffcc99; font-family: monospace;'>
"We would like to begin by acknowledging that we are in
___________, the ancestral and unceded territory of the ________
People."
</div>

The ostensible goal of these acknowledgments is to promote a "greater
public consciousness of Native sovereignty and cultural
rights."[^neefusa]

But strangely, these acknowledgments seem always a bit myopic. If
we're going to acknowledge ancestral and unceded territory of
modern-day North America, how far
back do we look? To the 
[Clovis
People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_culture)?

Clovis refers to the earliest[^debated] known prehistoric
Native American culture. One theory is that the
Clovis people crossed the [Bering Land
Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beringia) from Siberia and
moved south through an ice-free corridor into the central U.S.,
approximately 12,800 years ago. (See also [Peopling of the
Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopling_of_the_Americas).)

Clovis culture pre-dates our modern-day concept of land ownership, so
Clovis land could never have been legally ceded or given freely.

Today, all 574 federally recognized[^recognized] tribes (Cherokee,
Choctaw, Sioux, Comanche, Chnook, Inuit, etc.) occupy land that was
once the home of the Clovis people. This land, in turn, was
subsequently appropriated by Spanish explorers, English settlers, and
other European colonists.

Given what we know of human nature in general, and Native American
Nations in particular, it's safe to assume that the land
appropriation from the Clovis people (15,000 years ago) to modern
tribes (even prior to European colonization, circa 1492), was was
likely violent and unforgiving.

 * Violence between Native American tribes took many forms.[^violence]

 * War captives were executed in ritual ways, sometimes involving
   torture, as a form of spiritual justice or communal healing.[^war]

 * Indigenous slavery existed in some regions even before European
   contact.[^slavery]

 * Scalping occurred both before and after European contact, though
   colonial powers (like the British and French) later encouraged it
   with bounties.[^scalping]

 * Raiding was sometimes a way of life, targeting rival tribes or
   agricultural villages.[^raiding]

Not all was violence, of course. Many tribes maintained long-standing
peace with neighbors and used diplomacy, intermarriage, and trade to
manage relations.[^peace]

# Indigenous virtue signaling

In general use, "indigenous" means first, but it can also refer to
people, plants, or animals that originate from and have a
long-standing connection to a specific place. Other terms used
include "Native" and "First Nations."

So maybe acknowledging Clovis is going too far.

But the question remains: How far back _do_ we go when
acknowledging "public consciousness of Native sovereignty and
cultural rights"?

Many Native American nations are Indigenous (in the
not-necessarily-the-first sense) to North America, but some of these
tribes displaced other Indigenous groups, even before European
colonization.[^displaced] [^warfare]

So mostly it seems, we're [virtue
signaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_signalling). We're
better.

We're better because we're shaming ourselves for occupying unceded
land that was appropriated and occupied by a prior tribe that
occupied unceded land that was also likely appropriated and occupied
by a _prior_ prior tribe that occupied unceded land; and so on and so
forth, all the way back to the Clovis people, who's distant ancestors
ultimately originated in Africa.[^c1] [^c2]
