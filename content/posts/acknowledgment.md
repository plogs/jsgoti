At the beginning of many events
it's now fashionable to begin with
an _indigenous land acknowledgment_, usually something along these
lines:

<div style='margin-left: .5em; margin-right: .5em; padding: 1em; background-color: #ffcc99; font-family: monospace;'>
"We would like to begin by acknowledging that we are in
[insert PLACE NAME], the ancestral and unceded territory of the
[so-and-so] people."
</div>

The ostensible goal of these acknowledgments is to promote a "greater
public consciousness of Native sovereignty and cultural
rights." [^neefusa]

But strangely, these acknowledgments always seem a bit short-sighted,
given that they only acknowledge the previous land occupants. Not the
ones before them, or the ones before them, and so on, all the way
back to the [Clovis
People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_culture), the first
settlers of North America.

Clovis refers to the earliest [^debated] known prehistoric
Native American culture. One theory is that the
Clovis people crossed the [Bering Land
Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beringia) from Siberia and
moved south through an ice-free corridor into the central U.S.,
approximately 12,800 years ago. (See also [Peopling of the
Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopling_of_the_Americas).)

Clovis culture pre-dates our modern-day concept of land ownership, so
Clovis land could never have been legally ceded or given freely.

Today, the 574 federally recognized [^recognized] tribes (Cherokee,
Choctaw, Sioux, Comanche, Chnook, Inuit, etc.) occupy land that was
once the home of the Clovis people. This land, in turn, was
subsequently appropriated by Spanish explorers, English settlers, and
other European colonists.

Given what we know of human nature in general, and Native American
populations in particular, it seems safe to assume that
`land appropriation' throughout history (from the Clovis culture
thousands of years ago to modern tribes today -- even prior to
European colonization, circa 1492), was likely violent and
unforgiving.

 * Violence between Native American tribes took many forms. [^violence]

 * War captives were executed in ritual ways, sometimes involving
   torture, as a form of spiritual justice or communal healing. [^war]

 * Indigenous slavery existed in some regions even before European
   contact. [^slavery]

 * Scalping occurred both before and after European contact, though
   colonial powers (like the British and French) later encouraged it
   with bounties.[^scalping] [^scalp1] [^scalp2] [^scalp3] [^scalp4]

 * Raiding was sometimes a way of life, targeting rival tribes or
   agricultural villages. [^raiding]


Not all was violence, of course. Many tribes maintained long-standing
peace with neighbors and used diplomacy, intermarriage, and trade to
manage relations. [^peace]

Most of the time "indigenous" means first, but it can also refer to
people, plants, or animals that originate from, or have a
long-standing connection to, a specific place. Other terms used
include "Native" and "First Nations."

So maybe acknowledging Clovis is going back too far.

And yet the question remains: How far back _do_ we go when
acknowledging "public consciousness of Native sovereignty and
cultural rights"?

Native American nations today are "indigenous" to North America as
First Nations. Undoubtedly some of these First Nations
displaced _other_ Indigenous nations, even before
European colonization. [^displaced] [^warfare]

# Virtue signaling

So land acknowledgments are really just [virtue
signaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_signalling). We're
implying that our invading culture is somehow better than all of the
previous invading cultures.


It's better because we're willing to shame ourselves by drawing
attention to our occupation of unceded land that was unceremoniously
appropriated from an indigenous tribe that managed to occupy unceded
land from a prior indigenous tribe, who managed to occupy ancestral
and unceded territory from a previous prior tribe or nation; and so on
and so forth, all the way back to the Clovis people, who's distant
ancestors ultimately came from Africa. [^c1] [^c2]
