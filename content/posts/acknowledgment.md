In many organizations it's now fashionable to begin presentations
with an _indigenous land acknowledgment_, usually something along
these lines:

<div style='margin-left: .5em; margin-right: .5em; padding: 1em; background-color: #ffffcc; font-family: monospace;'>
"We would like to begin by acknowledging that we are in
___________, the ancestral and unceded territory of the ________
People."
</div>

The stated goal of these acknowledgments is to promote a "greater
public consciousness of Native sovereignty and cultural
rights."[^neefusa]


But strangely, these acknowledgments are always myopic. They look
only a few generations back. True ancestral acknowledgement reaches
back at least to the [Clovis
People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_culture).

(Note: The "Clovis First" hypothesis is now
[debated](https://bigthink.com/the-past/ice-free-corridor-clovis-americas/).
They may not have been the first.)

The Clovis culture refers to one of the earliest known prehistoric
Native American cultures in North America, recognized primarily for
its distinctive stone tools. It is named after the town of Clovis,
New Mexico, where such artifacts were first identified in the 1930s.

It was hypothesized that Clovis people crossed the [Bering Land
Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beringia) from Siberia and
moved south through an ice-free corridor into the central U.S., thus
becoming the first inhabitants of North America, approximately 12,800
years ago. (See also [Peopling of the
Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopling_of_the_Americas).)

Clovis culture pre-dates our modern concept of land ownership, thus
Clovis land could never have been legally ceded or given freely.
Successor cultures simply appropriated Clovis land as their own.

For example. All 574 federally recognized tribes[^recognized] still
in existence today (e.g, Cherokee, Choctaw, Sioux, Comanche, Chnook,
Inuit) occupy land once home only to the Clovis people. This land, in
turn, was appropriated by Spanish explorers, English settlers, and
other European colonists.

Given our present-day knowledge of Native American Nations, one may
assume that land appropriation and inadvertent culture death of the
past was violent and unforgiving.

 * Violence between Native American tribes took many forms.[^violence]

 * Raids were often conducted to steal horses, take captives, or exact
   revenge for past offenses.[^raids]

 * War captives were executed in ritual ways, sometimes involving
   torture, as a form of spiritual justice or communal healing.[^war]

 * Indigenous slavery existed in some regions even before European
   contact.[^slavery]

 * Scalping occurred both before and after European contact, though
   colonial powers (like the British and French) later encouraged it
   with bounties.[^scalping]

 * Raiding was sometimes a way of life, targeting rival tribes or
   agricultural villages.[^raiding]

Not all was violence, of course. Many tribes maintained long-standing
peace with neighbors and used diplomacy, intermarriage, and trade to
manage relations.[^peace]

# Indigenous virtue signaling

Modern humans evolved in Africa around 200,000--300,000 years ago.
Technically, all humans are migrants. None are indigenous.

However, we _can_ distinguish communities that existed autonomously
(e.g., the 574 federally recognized tribes still in existence today),
with their own social, political, and economic systems, before
outsiders arrived.


Unfortunately, many of the 'land acknowledgements' given to promote
public awareness of Native sovereignty and cultural rights sound more
like [virtue
signaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_signalling) than
consciousness raising; especially given that Native American tribes
engaged in warfare, territorial expansion, and the displacement of
other Indigenous groups long before and alongside European
colonization.[^warfare]
