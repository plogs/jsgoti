"Economics is an analysis of _cause-and-effect_ relationships in an
economy. Its purpose is to discern the consequences of various ways
of allocating scarce resources which have alternative uses. It has
nothing to say about social philosophy or moral values, any more than
it has anything to say about humor or anger."[^1]
