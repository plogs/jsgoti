## Beware the parasocial relationship

A parasocial relationship is a one-sided emotional attachment that a
viewer or audience member develops with a media personality (e.g., a
TV host, YouTuber, podcaster, or fictional character). While the
viewer may feel a sense of closeness or friendship, the media figure
has no awareness of the viewer's existence.

Key Features:

    Illusion of intimacy -- The viewer feels like they ``know'' the
    person.

    One-sided -- There's no mutual interaction.

    Emotional investment -- Viewers may feel joy, sadness, or loyalty.

    Common with frequent exposure -- Daily or weekly shows often foster
    stronger parasocial bonds.
