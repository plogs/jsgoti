## Pete Buttigieg Explains DEI to Regular Folks

I like Pete Buttigieg; I would likely vote for him if he runs for
president in 2028, but I disagree with him about Diversity, Equity,
and Inclusion (DEI).

I'm writing this because I want democrats to stop screwing up so
badly. I think the Republican party has lost it's way, and Democrats
are our only hope. But to quote Jeff Daniels' character from the
series The Newsroom, "You know why people don't
like liberals? Cause they lose. If liberals are so fucking smart, how
come they lose so god damn always?"[^1]

I want Democrats to stop screwing up. How do they screw up?

Well, here, for example, is how Pete Buttigieg Explains DEI to
Regular Folks[^2]

## Transcript, Pete Buttigieg speaking

"First of all, DEI stands for diversity, equity, and inclusion, right?"

"So to me we start by thinking okay what's the opposite of those
things?"

"The opposite of diversity is uniformity, right?"


<div style='margin-left: 2em; padding: 1em; background-color: white;'>

  Uh, no -- not necessarily. First we have to ask what exactly is
  meant by `diversity'? Does diversity in this context mean it's
  somehow better to hire or work with people with different skin
  color, different sexual orientations, different shoe sizes,
  different social-economic backgrounds, different heights, different
  IQs? What's the criteria -- and what makes the criteria relevant --
  for deciding which characteristics are diverse-worthy?


  Context matters.

  When it comes to hiring someone for a job, the opposite of
  diversity might be 'color blind'.

  And in some situations diversity is a weakness, not a strength.

  For example, anyone who has dealt with Customer Support from a
  non-native English speaker knows the importance of clear
  communication. Sometimes I just want to say, "Oh my gosh, please...
  give me more uniformity!"

  The usual and obvious counter example to 'diversity' are the
  players in the NBA (National Basketball Association). 70% of NBA
  players are Black (or African American). Does we need more Asians
  and Native Americans on our basketball teams in the name of
  diversity? I don't think so. Why would skin color, shoe size, or
  social-economic status matter when playing sports? And if it
  doesn't matter when shooting baskets on the basketball court, why
  would it matter when tightening bolts on a factory assembly line,
  or when pouring coffee at Starbucks?

  I think when DEI proponents say 'diversity' that's shorthand for
  'social engineering.' They want to fix society's discrimination
  problem, and forced diversity is their proposed way to do that. But
  there's very little rhyme or reason to the proposed solution. Not
  to mention the cost of giving someone an advantage because they're
  Black, or White, or Asian, or gay, or whatever. The whole point of
  working towards a non-discriminatory society is to stop treating
  people by their accidental and mostly irrelevant group
  characteristics, and, instead, treat everyone as an individual.

"The opposite of equity is inequity."

<div style='margin-left: 2em; padding: 1em; background-color: white;'>

  It's true that the opposite of equity is inequity, just as the
  opposite of fair is unfair. But what seems to be wanted here with
  DEI is not fairness, as in "everyone plays by the same rules," but
  rather, "equity means things should be equal."

  For example, if SOMEGROUP MEMBERS are 5% of the population, then
  DEI proponents presume that in an 'equitable' society we would
  expect to see 5% of SOMEGROUP MEMBERS in JOBS, POSITIONS, or
  WHATEVER. But why this type of distribution should be expected is
  never explained. Why do we expect all GROUPS to be equally
  proportionally distributed?

  One reason GROUPS might not be equally proportionally distributed
  is because -- statistically speaking -- different groups have
  different strengths and weaknesses.

  Culture, for example, plays a significant part in outcomes (again,
  statistically speaking).

  For example, the daily study time for Asian students (e.g., China)
  is as much as 11 hours. Whereas American students study for a
  whopping 1-2 hours. Regardless of the percentage of the population,
  which group do you think will do better on knowledge tests?

  Does it follow, then, that if the number of Asian students with
  highly technical and great paying jobs exceeds the proportional
  distribution of American students with highly technical and great
  paying jobs, that that's somehow 'inequitable'? Do we need to fix
  society because Asians do better then Whites?

  These different senses of 'equity' are often described as the
  difference between "equality of opportunity" and "equality of
  outcome".

  Equality of opportunity is the very definition of fairness:
  everyone plays by the same rules, every one gets a fair chance.
  Equality of outcome, on the other hand, is social engineering writ
  large. Equality of outcome adherents basically want to play god;
  they want to fix society to be the way it should be. There are two
  problems with social engineering. First, not everyone agrees on
  what the fix should be. And second, sometimes solutions have
  unintended side effects, which then create even bigger problems.

</div>

"And the opposite of inclusion is exclusion."




"And I don't know a lot of people who think we'd be better off if our
lives had more uniformity, inequity, and exclusion, right?"

"But I think part of why people have questions about it, that I
respect, is they're not sure if this is they're worried about
fairness, right?"

"So to me when you talk about some of these policies the idea is to
make sure everybody gets a seat at the table, especially if you know
there have been systematic ways of keeping people from getting a seat
at the table over the years, sometimes based on their race, on their
religion, on their income, on their background, any number of
reasons. Sexuality, right?"

"Like a lot of different reasons, and it's about making sure that what
we do going forward is fair."

"And this can be an economic issue, too."

"You look at something like redlinining. A lot of homeowners, families
would be homeowners, especially black families, couldn't get homes in
certain neighborhoods where the property value started to go up, so
even if that happened to a family, I don't know 50 years ago, their
kids are living with the consequences of that now because their
family has less wealth because they were kept out of a neighborhood
where property values were growing, right?"

"And so part of it's the idea that some of these things may have
started a long time ago. Maybe nobody alive today is responsible for
some of the injustice that has shaped what it's like to live in this
country right now, but all of us now are responsible for doing
something about it."
