## Pete Buttigieg Explains DEI to Regular Folks

I like Pete Buttigieg; I would likely vote for him if he runs for
president in 2028, but I disagree with him about Diversity, Equity,
and Inclusion -- usually refered to as DEI.

I'm writing this because I want democrats to stop screwing up so
badly. I think the Republican party has lost it's way, and Democrats
are our only hope. But to quote Jeff Daniels' character from the
series The Newsroom, "You know why people don't
like liberals? Cause they lose. If liberals are so fucking smart, how
come they lose so god damn always?"[^1]

I want Democrats to stop screwing up.

Here's how they screw up.

## Transcript

First of all, DEI stands for diversity, equity, and inclusion, right?

So to me we start by thinking okay what's the opposite of those
things?

The opposite of diversity is uniformity, right?


    Uh, no -- not necessarily. First we have to ask what exactly is meant
    by `diversity'? Does diversity in this context mean it's somehow
    better to hire or work with people with different skin color,
    different sexual orientations, different shoe sizes, different
    social-economic backgrounds, different heights, different IQs?
    What's the criteria -- and what makes the criteria relevant --
    for deciding which characteristics are diverse-worthy?

    Context matters.

    The opposite of diversity might be 'color blind'.

    In fact, in some situations diversity is a weakness, not a
    strength.

    For example, anyone who has dealt with Customer Support from a
    non-native English speaker knows the importance of uniformity in
    communication. Oh my gosh, sometimes... please give me more
    uniformity!

    And of course there's the usual NBA counter example. Do we want
    more Asians and Native Americans on our basketball teams, more
    diversity for the sake of diversity? Because somehow a different
    skin color or social-economic status or a different shoe size
    necessarily makes one a better basketball player?

    I think what Buttigieg and others mean by 'diversity' is 'social
    engineering.' They want to fix society's problems, and diversity
    is a proposed way to do that. But there's very little rhyme or
    reason to the proposed solution. Not to mention the cost of
    giving someone an advantage because they're black, or white, or
    asian, or gay, or whatever. We're trying to get away from
    treating individuals as members of groups, not encourage it.





The opposite of equity is inequity.

And the opposite of inclusion is exclusion.


And I don't know a lot of people who think we'd be better off if our
lives had more uniformity, inequity, and exclusion, right?

But I think part of why people have questions about it, that I
respect, is they're not sure if this is they're worried about
fairness, right?

So to me when you talk about some of these policies the idea is to
make sure everybody gets a seat at the table, especially if you know
there have been systematic ways of keeping people from getting a seat
at the table over the years, sometimes based on their race, on their
religion, on their income, on their background, any number of
reasons. Sexuality, right?

Like a lot of different reasons, and it's about making sure that what
we do going forward is fair.

And this can be an economic issue, too.

You look at something like redlinining. A lot of homeowners, families
would be homeowners, especially black families, couldn't get homes in
certain neighborhoods where the property value started to go up, so
even if that happened to a family, I don't know 50 years ago, their
kids are living with the consequences of that now because their
family has less wealth because they were kept out of a neighborhood
where property values were growing, right?

And so part of it's the idea that some of these things may have
started a long time ago. Maybe nobody alive today is responsible for
some of the injustice that has shaped what it's like to live in this
country right now, but all of us now are responsible for doing
something about it.
